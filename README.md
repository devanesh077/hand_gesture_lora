<u> Hand Gesture Controlled Robot with LoRa Communication </u>

This project features a hand gesture-controlled robot that interprets human hand movements to guide the robot's actions. Unlike conventional designs, which often rely on short-range communication modules like NRF24L01, this project upgrades the communication system by incorporating a LoRa module, enabling greater range and reliability.

Features
Hand Gesture Recognition: Accurately captures and translates human hand gestures into robotic commands.

LoRa Communication Module: Replaces the NRF module to provide an extended communication range, making the robot functional across larger distances.

Efficient Control: Real-time responsiveness for seamless operation.

Applications: Useful for search and rescue, remote operations, and as a learning project for gesture recognition and robotics.

Usage
Turn on the wearable controller equipped with gesture sensors and LoRa module.

Power the robot, which includes a receiver connected to the LoRa module.

Use predefined hand gestures to control the robot's movements, such as:

Forward

Backward

Left

Right
